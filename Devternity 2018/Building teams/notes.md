# Secret Sauce to successful teams
>Sven Peters

## Compeling Direction
### Give teams a North Star. 
A direction and vision that they can work towards and a goal for them. A longer term thing

Themes come under this, for what is important

Then a focus area. A specific part of the North Star goal

Measure the success and the focus areas. Are we moving forward and is it heading towards the North Star

Vision
Team
Focus
Measure

### Measure
Can use OKR's for this.
Objective, Key results

### Understand feedback
The customer is important, and understanding what they want and need is important to help drive the team goals

## Strong Structure
### Common language
Have a comming language so people can all understand the work that is happening

### Cross functional teams
Cross functional teams can help with the commong language. But that doesn't mean they have to be rigid. If people need to work on different teams, they should be able to move from their team for a short time.

Having the whole team deeply integrated can result in faster movement and cycle times. Everyone is able to collaborate and help guide eachother 

#### Team routines
Teams do a 'fika' - Swedish. Having a coffee together, sitting together and integrating. No work/laptops/emails

#### Team refreshments
Getting stuff done days. Days when the team can "just get stuff done". Time to do things they're not usually able to do.

#### Innovation week
Hackathons or time to try anything product related they'd like to try

### Appreciate others
Be able to give team members feedback

Ensure welcoming culture is truly welcoming and engaging


## Information
Information should be shared and open so people feel they are welcome and have access to everything they need. Secrets within teams are bad
### Locked information
Be able to provide people information that is easily accessible

Schedule 1:1's

Meetings if you need a specific time

Emails

### Open information
Intranet

Chat rooms

## Shared Mindset
Share the responsibilities across the team. Bug fixes are shared etc. This goes for feature development as well. Ensure the team is involved in new feature development. This can be done with 'feature buddies' to work together on features

## Summary
High performance teams 'Do the Right Things'. Process can often get in the way for this. Process should be adaptable, allowing teams to do things their way to work as best as they can. Agile teams

This can be driven and supported by other teams who have had similar experience. Atlassian Playbook has a lot of their experience and learnings in it
