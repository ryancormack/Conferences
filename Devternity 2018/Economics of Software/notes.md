## 3 Values of Software

What business value does software add?
- Features
- Design
- Feedback

### Cost of features and design
Poor design allows quick and cheap features to be added at the start, but very quickly and exponentially grows for it to become hard to add anything

Evolutionary design has a higher initial cost and then increases slowly, but it still increases

You don't know when the tradeoff of poor design and cheap/quick features and evolutionary design and slower/expensive features kicks in

It almost always ends up with this point arriving and software becoming unmaintainable. Evolutionary design should happen at the start

### Feedback
Short feedback cycles increase throughput through that part of the system

From customer feedback, to design feedback, to code/test feedback, to profitability
